=head1 NAME

IPC::Signal::Force - function to force default handling of a signal

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use IPC::Signal::Force qw(force_raise);

	force_raise "TERM";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports one function, C<force_raise>, which invokes a default
signal handler regardless of the signal's current handling.

package IPC::Signal::Force;

use warnings;
use strict;

use Exporter;
use IPC::Signal qw(sig_num);
use POSIX qw(SIG_SETMASK SIG_UNBLOCK sigprocmask);

our $VERSION = "0.000";

our @ISA = qw(Exporter);

our @EXPORT_OK = qw(force_raise);

=item force_raise(SIGNAL)

SIGNAL must be the name of a signal (e.g., "TERM").  The specified signal
is delivered to the current process, with the handler for the signal
temporarily reset to the default.  The signal is also temporarily
unblocked if it was initially blocked.  The overall effect is to
synchronously invoke the default handler for the signal, regardless of
how the signal would be handled the rest of the time.

This is mainly useful in a handler for the same signal, if the handler
wants to do something itself and also call the default handler.
For example, a handler for SIGTERM might shut down the program neatly
and then C<force_raise("TERM")>, which achieves a graceful shutdown
while also letting the parent process see that the process terminated
due to a signal rather than by C<exit()>.

A similar, but slightly more complex, case is a handler for SIGTSTP
(tty-initiated stop), which in a curses-style program might need to
restore sane tty settings, C<force_raise("TSTP")>, and then (after
the process has been restarted) reassert control of the tty and redraw
the screen.

	my $sigset = new POSIX::SigSet $signum;
	my $mask = new POSIX::SigSet;
	local $SIG{$signame};
	kill $signame, 0;
	sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, $sigset, $mask);
	if($mask->ismember($signum)) {
		sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, $mask, $mask);
	}
}
